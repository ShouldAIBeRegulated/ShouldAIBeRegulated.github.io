              There are a few ways to look at the state of AI development.
              Growth of this proportion will almost always prompt a response, be
              it from the private or public sector. In that sense, a great deal
              of people have agreed on two points. First, the state of
              regulation surrounding AI is clearly lacking. Second, we need to
              work proactively and swiftly to remedy this. Here’s a look into
              this side of the debate.
            </p>

            <p>
              In fact, this field grew so quickly, expanding far outside of its
              origin in niche computer science, that it garnered the attention
              of the government. Currently, legislation surrounding computers in
              general is flimsy and vague, but that looks like it’s on track to
              change.
            </p>

            <p>
              In September of 2018,
              <a
                href="https://www.fedscoop.com/artificial-intelligence-in-government-act/"
              >
                a group of senators has pushed the government to enact
                legislation
              </a>
              legislation on the federal level that will open the doors for more
              comprehensive regulation of AI technology. The purpose of this
              bill is to promote US competitiveness in the new field, but to
              also serve to protect us from the potential risks associated with
              such powerful technology. It’s clear that the attitude towards the
              regulation of AI is taking a favorable turn with the development
              of this legislation.

            <p>
              It’s not just the government that is having thoughts about
              restricting AI, however. In fact, the government seems to be one
              of the late actors on this issue. Industry experts and researchers
              have been in talks about possible restrictions on AI tech for
              years. An example would be Microsoft Research Scholar Kate
              Crawford, who warns of the inevitability of AI bias. In essence,
              we cannot truly take what an AI says as truth- it’s simply
              irrational to assume an AI is always correct.
            </p>

            <p>
              As powerful and accurate as AI technology will become, issues will
              certainly arise if we allow it to be used for purposes such as
              <a

                >deciding between two people to kill in a car accident</a
              >
              , or
              <a
                href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tiriasresearch/2018/01/24/management-ai-bias-criminal-recidivism-and-the-promise-of-machine-learning/#282b75377c8a"
              >
                deciding whether a criminal is likely to commit a crime again</a
              >. As such technologies slowly become a reality, this truth
              becomes more and more important for us to understand. The
              ‘TheNextWeb’ article linked above mentions that we will have to
              accept that our new technology will certainly fail a few times-
              that is, we won’t get it perfect the first time around. However,
              it’s probably better for regulations to decide when it’s
              appropriate to test technology that will surely have inaccuracies.
              As long as there is error and bias in AI, which at this moment is
              inevitable, using it for processes of magnitude as great as
              deciding a human’s fate may be too much for now, and should
              therefore at least be regulated.
            </p>

            <p>
              Some people in the corporate world have also expressed their
              concern for the continued development of AI tech. Specifically,
              Elon Musk has taken a very clear stance on the issue. Not only has
              he invested heavily in
              <a href="https://openai.com/">
                one of the fastest growing AI research think tanks
              </a>
              in the world, but he claims to have only done so to ‘keep an eye’
              on such technology. Since then, he’s taken steps to carefully
              integrate AI into his other companies, Tesla and SpaceX.
            </p>

            <span class="caption text-muted"

            >

            <p>
              He believes that the government ‘steps in after too many bad
              things happen,’ and that instead of looking at the benefits of AI,
              we should focus on taking proactive steps to implement solutions
              to the massive moral and ethical issues that the cutting age of AI
              will face.
            </p>

            <p>
              Overall, the frightening pace of AI development has inspired many
              to take this middleground path; not to let it free or stop it
              entirely, but to instead proceed with caution and act proactively
              to prevent disaster.
