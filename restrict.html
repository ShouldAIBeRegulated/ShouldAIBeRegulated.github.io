            <h2 class="section-header">Kate Crawford</h2>
            <p>
              Kate Crawford is a Microsoft Research Scholar who is well
              respected in the tech industry. She is also a Distinguished
              research professor at New York University, and her work regarding
              machine learning is unparalleled. As a person who is well
              ingrained in the field of Artificial Intelligence research, she
              has some strong opinions of her own. In particular, she’s worried
              about how much we will actually believe the answers an unbounded
              AI will give us.
            </p>

            <p>
              The professor claims that AI cannot truly be free of bias. She
              states that we are at a moment in history where AI development and
              AI produced results do not imply actual truth. This itself could
              be detrimental to human society if it were determining anything
              substantial, such as involvement in a crime, or likelihood to even
              commit crime again.
            </p>

            <p>
              Whether it’s helping governmental regimes achieve their own ends,
              whatever they may be, or helping companies in the private sector
              take advantage of existing societal structures, she believes AI
              can operate without clear restriction in many ways. She brings to
              light many such creations, a very notable example being when
              President Trump tried to persuade data company Palantir to create
              a Muslim registry using AI.
            </p>

            <p>
              She states that it’s best to be skeptical about anything that is
              ‘free of bias’, as it was originally trained with human data. She
              states that AI can be used to these ends, and it might be slightly
              worrying given the implications- decision making power in the
              hands of a biased entity is a scary thing.
            </p>

            <p>
              In other words, we really can’t trust AI technology in the way
              that it operates right now- the restrictions around it are just
              simply not stringent enough. Crawford’s argument is that we simply
              need to establish more bounds and regulation for this tech, to
              improve the ethics in its use, as well as the accuracy of the
              software itself.
            </p>

            <p>
              She closes with some remarks that carry a sense of futility; she
              reminds us that AI technology will inevitably be used to ends such
              as the ones she has described. Nevertheless, she emphasizes that
              we should remain wary and prepare ourselves for a future in which
              AI opinion might be held at a much higher regard than it is now.
              This means we will effectively be controlled by such technologies,
              whether they have the proper restrictions and boundaries set upon
              them or not. She ends the interview with an ominous warning: “Done
              right, AI can be used to keep power structures in check. But in
              the wrong hands…”

            <h2 class="section-heading">Elon Musk</h2>

            <p>
              One cannot go a day in the tech industry without reading a news
              article about famous business magnate Elon Musk. Needless to say,
              he’s got some pretty interesting opinions regarding AI. Here are
              his two cents on the issue.
            </p>

            <p>
              Elon musk seems to view AI development with a general air of
              caution. Not only is he at the forefront of AI development as the
              head of Tesla in its effort to create self-driving cars, he is
              also a bastion of the tech industry in general, holding key chunks
              of companies that are all the centerpieces of the tech industry.
              In other words, Musk’s knowledge and expertise is nothing short of
              first class in the world of tech.
            </p>

            <p>
              Musk says that the solution is to take a more proactive approach.
              He states that we should be proactive instead of reactive in the
              field of AI, as we have to take special care to set constraints
              upon what we develop. He states his distaste for the current way
              of handling things, which he claims is when the government ‘steps
              in after too many bad things happen’. In other words, he believes
              current policy regarding regulation only makes the government step
              in when it will be too late.
            </p>

            <p>
              Aside from his pop culture references, however, we cannot forget
              that Musk is working on one of the most advanced AI technologies
              of our time, Tesla Autopilot, which will eventually face plenty of
              moral conflicts. An example of these would be if an AI had to
              decide who to kill in a crash- a young or old person.
            </p>

            <p>
              Furthermore, Musk likes to engage in behaviors where he keeps a
              watchful eye over AI development. He has admitted to holding
              stakes in AI companies simply to ‘take a look’ at what was being
              developed, so that he himself could be prepared to see the changes
              in AI industry. This goes to show how wary he was of AI
              development as a whole.
            </p>

            <p>
              Musk may be at the cutting edge of AI technology as we know it,
              but he seems to be very fearful of it as a whole and advocates for
              a future in which we impose very stringent restrictions on AI
              itself. If not, he warns, we could be in a lot of trouble.
