            <h2 class="section-heading">Tim Cook</h2>

            <p>
              Tim Cook is the CEO of Apple, but despite the fact that his
              company is adding more and more AI into its codebase by the week,
              he refuses to even explore that future with a reporter. In
              essence, Cook states that it’s not that he doesn’t know the
              direction his company is taking in terms of AI. He instead claims
              that he does not like that direction, and he’d simply rather not
              discuss it.
            </p>

            <p>
              Although this seems like a weak and worrying statement for the CEO
              of one of the world’s most cutting edge AI companies to make, it
              certainly holds some weight.
            </p>

            <p>APPLE STORE PICTURE</p>

            <p>
              In other words, Cook is not doubtful in his analysis. He knows the
              direction of his company completely. What he is uncomfortable
              about exploring with the press is the clearly muddled implications
              of what is to come out of his company in the future.
            </p>

            <p>
              Optimally, he wishes that the company will never get there, so
              that he does not have to grapple with those issues himself. He
              feels that the current pace of AI development is simply
              inappropriate, as we have not truly understood AI yet.
            </p>

            <p>
              Cook is a man who prides his company on delivering features that
              they believe in. AI is a feature that he believes is, at its core,
              morally, ethically, and even capably ambiguous. He doesn’t know
              what should be the limit of its functionality and its access, as
              he believes we simply shouldn’t have to deal with something so
              potentially dangerous given our current circumstances.
            </p>

            <p>
              Most importantly, Cook states that he is not comfortable with full
              scale automation and AI deployment. He states that when
              ‘technological advancement can go up exponentially, I think
              there’s a risk of losing sight that tech should serve humanity,
              not the other way around.” Clearly, Cook is thinking of the true
              implications of deploying powerful AI.
            </p>

            <p>
              One thing is for sure right now- Tim Cook, and as a result, his
              company, is not keen on exploring the future of ever-increasing AI
              development as a technology to integrate into products.
            </p>

            <h2 class="section-heading">Stephen Hawking</h2>

            <p>
              Among those who believed that AI will spiral out of control is the
              late renowned professor Stephen Hawking. Prof. Hawking says that
              the technology in AI we have may be quite useful now, but his
              fears will truly culminate when AI surpasses the power of humans.
            </p>

            <p>
              He states the possible existence of a superintelligence, claiming
              that such an intelligence would be able to iterate upon itself and
              build itself to become even better. In other words, this software
              would be so intelligent that it would be able to update itself.
            </p>

            <p>
              Hawking believes that this point will be the point where we as a
              race will confront a massive issue.
            </p>

            <p>
              Experts claim that we are still quite a ways off from achieving
              the compute power to develop an AI that is a true artificial
              intelligence, but they can’t ultimately know whether the result
              will be detrimental, beneficial, or indifferent to humans.
            </p>

            <p>
              Hawking believes that the future could go in one of two
              directions. Once the development of AI reaches a point where it
              can perform all the tasks that a human needs to in order to
              survive, it will be faced with a couple of options.
            </p>

            >

            <p>
              If the wealth created by the presence of all these machines is
              distributed among the people, everyone will benefit and enjoy
              lives of plenty. However, if the wealth is controlled and not
              redistributed, we will experience poverty and disparity the likes
              of which we have never seen before.
            </p>

            <p>
              He claims that, in his opinion, the world is currently leaning
              towards the latter option. In that sense, Hawking drops his
              worrisome viewpoint that we are indeed veering towards a very
              dangerous path with the development of AI. If anything, the
              restructuring of human psychology and society has to precede such
              an astronomical development in AI, or we will be finished for
              sure.
              (https://qz.com/1231092/ai-gave-stephen-hawking-a-voice-and-he-used-it-to-warn-us-against-ai/
              )
            </p>

            <p>
              Essentially, Hawking claims that we are going down the wrong path
              socio-politically, and that in turn is why our foray into powerful
              general intelligence will lead us to our doom. He ultimately
              advocates for the idea that we in our current state should not
              face this issue.
