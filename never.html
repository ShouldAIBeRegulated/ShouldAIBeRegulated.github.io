              Despite the fact that many welcome the never-ending stream of
              innovation that is AI technology, there are still those who would
              value a break. What some may call an astronomical amount of
              progress, others may call worrisome. As our technology rapidly
              advances, the complementary political and moral infrastructure
              that we have must adjust to keep up. Some hold the opinion that
              this sort of unprecedented growth requires a major restructuring
              to the way we think, or that we shouldn’t even continue
              advancement at all, for our own good.

              Once again, a CEO dictates the attitude of the company under them.
              In that sense, CEO Tim Cook of Apple is known for attention to
              detail and consideration of ‘the little things’. In many ways,
              Apple is viewed as a perfectionist, refined company. For that very
              same reason, Cook claims that he simply dislikes the direction his
              company is going in terms of integrating AI, and that he

              Although this is a seemingly weak statement for the CEO of one of
              the world’s largest corporations, make no mistake. This is the
              plight of a company prey to its market. Inevitably, the market
              will move towards integrating all of these novel AI technologies.
              The major issue is, the pace at which this technology is
              developing is simply inappropriate, because we have not truly
              understood how to apply the technology.
            </p>

            <p>
              In addition to what we simply don’t know about the future of AI,
              we have to consider what is already happening. With
              <a
                href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2018/04/18/will-robots-and-ai-take-your-job-the-economic-and-political-consequences-of-automation/"
                >the recent spike in development of AI-based job automation</a
              >, AI technology is having a very real effect on our already
              established economy. In fact, deployment of job-automation
              software on even larger scales would consequently lead to
              unemployment on equally large scales. The resulting wealth
              disparity could arguably dismantle our economy as we know it, on a
              national or global scale.
            </p>

            <p>
              Looking further into the future gives way for even more radical
              possibilities.
            </p>

            <p>
              The late professor Stephen Hawking explores this possible future,
              going so far as to make the claim that when AI development reaches
              a point where AI can perform all tasks that we as humans have to
              do to sustain ourselves, we will be faced with
              <a
                href="https://qz.com/1231092/ai-gave-stephen-hawking-a-voice-and-he-used-it-to-warn-us-against-ai/"
                >a choice</a
              >- distribute it evenly and prosper, or allow for our capitalistic
              society to distribute this wealth in a top-heavy manner.
            </p>

            <a href="#">
              <img class="img-fluid" src="img/hawking.jpg" alt="" />

            <span class="caption text-muted"
              >The late Professor Hawking. ImageSpot.</span
            >

            <p>
              The latter choice, which Professor Hawking was certain we would
              end up making, would usher in an age of the first trillionaires
              and simultaneously, poverty and famine on an unimaginable scale.
              In other words, Hawking was convinced that AI would truly end
              civilation as we know it.
            </p>

            <p>
              There are essentially two schools of thought in terms of stopping
              AI development in its tracks. The first school of thought,
              demonstrated by Apple CEO Tim Cook, is backed by the idea that we
              simply do not understand it, and we would need to stop advancement
              and take some time to evaluate the future before continuing
              development. Another school of thought is Hawking’s even more
              pessimistic point of view, directly opposite of Satya Nadella’s
              point of view in the previous article: the way our society works
              today guarantees that the inception of a super-intelligent AI
              would lead to our demise.
            </p>

            >

            <p>
              Either way, in the words of Ian Malcolm from Jurassic Park, it’s
              clear that we as a society were so engrossed with the idea that we
              could, we didn’t stop to think if we should in the first place.
