          <p>
            AI as a concept, although fascinating, is not truly essential to
            this debate. AI itself is the innate ability of a computer to make
            decisions it is not explicitly told to make, based on its own
            knowledge. Over the years, computer scientists have found various
            ways to create this phenomenon within computer programs. However, it
            is not the mere concept of AI, but the applications of it that sits
            at the root of this debate. In recent years, AI technology has
            become so developed and available that it’s being leveraged for a
            multitude of purposes. As these purposes grow to encompass more and
            more parts of everyday life, it becomes increasingly more important
            to examine the implications of these formidable technologies.

            Now, more than ever, we are witness to the lightning-fast pace of AI
            technology advancement. Facial recognition technology doesn’t just
            help us unlock our phones, it allows us to be spied on in public and

            Not only does Machine learning help us identify the emotional value
            in a text message, but it also helps companies optimize sales by
            determining what to sell us and at what price. Self-driving cars do
            not just let us adjust our hair while we’re driving, it may have to

            Common psychological problems that humans have grappled with for
            years, the basis of our very own morals to this date, are just now
            being explored by artificial intelligence. A great example of this
            relates to the issue of Tesla’s self driving cars deciding between
            two people to kill in a car accident, given they have an equal
            opportunity to kill one of two people, but not save both. For an
            example of such a problem, take a moment to check out the infamous
            <a href="http://www.trolleydilemma.com">'trolley problem'</a> which
            became an internet phenomenon in early 2018.

            As artificial intelligence, powered by industry leaders such as
            Google, Facebook, and Apple, ingrains itself further into our lives,
            we are forced to consider it from many perspectives aside from just
            technological advancement alone. It is simply not enough to ignore
            the obvious ethical and moral implications that come with such
            powerful technology anymore.

          <h2 class="section-heading">A Response Is Needed</h2>

          <p>
            The truth is, AI is developing faster than we as a species ever
            imagined. The fact that we ourselves cannot accurately predict what
            will transpire as a result of this technology is a fairly sizable
            red flag in and of itself. That being said, action needs to be
            taken. Many ways of dealing with these changes have been proposed by
            a multitude of people, ranging from high-profile tech CEOs, to
            University Professors, to Tech Journalists to the engineers that
            built this technology themselves.
          </p>

          <p>
            Overall, opinions are divided. As of now, there seems to be no
            dominant, prominent voice urging us to move towards true
            laissez-faire development of AI-tech or a locked-down heavily
            scrutinized development model.
          </p>

          <p>
            Despite the fact that there is so much disagreement on this subject,
            technology nevertheless continues to advance. As the renowned Sam
            Harris, a neuroscientist, researcher and philosopher, would say:

            “Fifty years is not that much time to meet one of the greatest
            challenges our species will ever face”

          <h2 class="section-heading">What Will It Be?</h2>

          <p>
            The decision is yours to make. So, what’s it going to be? Take a
            look at these stances and decide for yourself.
          </p>

            Should we <a href="restrict.html">restrict AI development</a>? Or
            maybe let development

              >continue without restrictions at all?</a
            >
            Or should we just
