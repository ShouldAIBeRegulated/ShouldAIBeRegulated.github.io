              AI is a technology that should be allowed to grow and flourish as
              it does. Although some may see certain detriments that come with
              the ever-increasing pace of AI-tech development, the benefits that
              come along with it far outweigh the costs, figuratively and
              literally.

            <h2 class="section-heading">Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft</h2>

            <p>
              Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella is one of the people at the forefront
              of AI development. He states that AI can make the world far more
              inclusive, citing the fact that there are billions of people in
              the world who are not partaking in societies or economies. He goes
              on to claim that the rise of AI can allow such people to have
              opportunities not previously presented to them. He states that
              such tasks as this, which are difficult for humans to direct
              manpower and time towards, are much more suited for optimization
              by artificial intelligence. Humans on this planet will certainly
              need the help of AI to make sure everybody lives on an even
              playing field.
            </p>

            <p>
              Overall, from eliminating bias in decisions usually skewed by
              human bias to even eventually being able to communicate with his
              son, who has cerebral palsy, Nadella chooses to focus on the
              overwhelming benefit that comes with AI. He states that it is a
              foundational challenge of AI to create tools that humans can
              constrain, but he stands behind his corporation’s method of making
              sure their work is okay; the developers set their own standards.
              This leads to a fairly quick developmental model, without any
              government limitation on what is being created. Ultimately,
              Nadella believes innovation like this will propel the world into a
              new generation of prosperity, and the best way to get there is to
              simply let AI development run its course and trust that work will
              be done responsibly. As the CEO of a large tech company, it’s his
              job to lead this revolution, so he is determined that his approach
              is the correct one. We can expect Microsoft and its employees to
              ultimately ‘follow the leader’ and adopt this point of view.

            <h2 class="section-heading">TechCrunch: Technology Enthusiasts</h2>

            <p>
              From the perspective of people who’ve been using tech for a long
              time, AI is nothing short of a modern marvel. When you’ve come to
              appreciate technology, along with its nuances, strengths and
              weaknesses, like the writers at TechCrunch have, you develop a new
              respect for the true capabilities of AI. That being said,
              TechCrunch writers are championing the development of AI. They
              speak of the capabilities of AI as if it will change the world,
              and they also mention how the benefits will clearly outweigh the
              possible issues that AI development presents.

              Ray Kurzweil: Heavily Involved Computer Scientist
            </h2>

            <p>
              Kurzweil looks at the clear benefits. In his TIME article, he
              focuses on what would be important to the layman reading the
              paper. As he has experience as a computer scientist himself being
              very involved in the AI behind optical character recognition, his
              ideas are well educated and supported by his clear experience in
              the field. He mentions all the benefits of AI technology. In this
              way his argument is not one which refutes the counterarguments- he
              simply ignores them. He claims that the benefits are so
              astronomical, and that we will truly become a better race because
              of them. Due to this alone, his argument that AI should not be
              fear stands. Unlike Nadella, he goes deeper into actually
              exploring some restrictions upon AI development, but those seem to
              be afterthoughts in the face of his true treatment of AI.
